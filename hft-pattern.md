| #  | Pattern (family)                                            | How it works in one sentence                                                                                                                   | Real-world illustration                                                                                                                                                                |

| 1  | **Passive / Inventory Market-Making**                       | Quote both sides of the book, continuously re-hedging inventory so the tiny bid–ask spread becomes profit.                                     | Flow Traders posts two-sided prices in > 13 000 ETFs every day, making it Europe’s largest ETF market maker. ([en.wikipedia.org][1])                                                   |
| 2  | **Statistical Arbitrage (StatArb)**                         | Mine short-horizon mean-reversion or correlation breakdowns across hundreds of symbols, flattening to cash by the close.                       | GSA Capital and the later spin-out XTX Markets were built on Deutsche Bank’s stat-arb desk DNA. ([ft.com][2], [daytrading.com][3])                                                     |
| 3  | **Index / ETF Arbitrage & Futures-Cash ‘Basis’**            | Exploit micro-mis-pricing between an index future/ETF and the live basket, locking in the spread via “create-redeem” or opposite futures legs. | Citadel Securities is the largest NYSE designated market-maker and routinely arbitrages SPY vs. S\&P 500 constituents. ([en.wikipedia.org][4], [en.wikipedia.org][5])                  |
| 4  | **Triangular & Cross-Exchange Arbitrage**                   | In FX or crypto, simultaneously trade three venues/pairs so price*quantity*fees nets a near-risk-free gain.                                    | IMC and Optiver run EUR/USD → USD/JPY → EUR/JPY triangles on CME and EBS when latencies diverge. ([daytrading.com][3], [reuters.com][6])                                               |
| 5  | **Latency Arbitrage**                                       | Beat slower participants to stale quotes that exist for only a few micro-seconds between venues or SIP feeds.                                  | Euronext’s new in-data-centre dark pool was launched *specifically* to remove latency-arbitrage edges. ([fnlondon.com][7], [bloomberg.com][8])                                         |
| 6  | **Event / News-Based HFT**                                  | NLP engines parse earnings headlines, macro releases or even tweets, then fire orders before humans finish reading.                            | Many equity-index futures spike within < 5 ms of US payrolls as news algos act; “news-based trading” is an SEC-recognised HFT class. ([financialsource.co][9], [en.wikipedia.org][10]) |
| 7  | **Momentum Ignition *(manipulative)***                      | Rapid small buys/sells try to “ignite” a short-lived trend, exit once slower algos pile on.                                                    | The SEC’s 2010 market-structure Concept Release explicitly names momentum-ignition as an HFT abuse risk. ([sec.gov][11])                                                               |
| 8  | **Liquidity Detection / Order-Anticipation *(borderline)*** | Probe the book with small IOC/pegged orders to infer a large hidden buyer, then step in ahead of them.                                         | “Order-anticipation strategies” are singled out in SEC comment letters on high-speed trading. ([sec.gov][12])                                                                          |
| 9  | **Dark-Pool / Mid-Point Arbitrage**                         | Hit a midpoint dark pool when the protected quote just moved, pocketing half-tick price improvement before prints update elsewhere.            | European exchanges are rolling out latency-controlled midpoint books to stop exactly this tactic. ([fnlondon.com][7])                                                                  |
| 10 | **Quote Stuffing *(manipulative)***                         | Blast and cancel thousands of quotes per second to clog data feeds, then trade on the lag you created.                                         | “Quote stuffing” entered the lexicon after Nanex’s post-Flash-Crash research and is now a textbook HFT abuse. ([en.wikipedia.org][13])                                                 |
| 11 | **Spoofing / Layering *(manipulative & illegal)***          | Place large visible orders you never intend to fill to fake supply-demand and trade on the reaction.                                           | Northwest Bio’s lawsuit against Citadel & Virtu alleges coordinated spoofing to depress its stock. ([ft.com][14], [en.wikipedia.org][15])                                              |
| 12 | **Order-Book ML / Micro-Structure Prediction**              | Deep-learning models infer the next mid-price move from the multi-level limit-order book, executing only when confidence exceeds fees.         | Recent research (“LOBFrame”) shows state-of-the-art neural nets forecasting NASDAQ ticks with actionable accuracy.
